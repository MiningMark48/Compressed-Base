Direwolf20's Favorite Base in a Single Block!

In the mod, the player can craft a Compressed Base that has the ability to spawn Direwolf20's favorite base, a 9x9, with the ability to also add extensions.

Doing so is extremely easy and fairly inexpensive.

First, the player needs to craft the needed components necessary for crafting the base. Once the components have been crafted, the player can then make the Compressed Base.

**Using the Compressed Base:**

- Place the block in a desired location
- To preview where the base will spawn, do Shift + Right Click. A render will be displayed showing the area the base will occupy. The render will disappear after 10 seconds by default.
- Right Click the Compressed Base
- If valid, a 9x9 base will spawn centered around the block.

**Using extensions:**

- Craft a Compressed Base Extension
- Place the extensions in a desired pattern around the Compressed Base (L, +, or T)
- To preview where the base and extensions will spawn, do Shift + Right Click. A render will be displayed showing the area the entire base will occupy. The render will disappear after 10 seconds by default.
- Right Click the Compressed Base
- If valid, a 9x9 base will spawn with extensions in the desired pattern centered around the block.

**Using the Base Previewer:**

- Shift + Right Click on a block to bind, a preview will be shown
- Right Click to unbind, hiding the preview
- Things to note:
  - You can also bind to a Compressed Base to render the base and its extensions
  - Only one block can be bound per item
  - The render only shows while holding the item

**Reasons for being invalid:**

- The base will occupy an area containing:
  - An unbreakable block, such as bedrock
  - A tile entity, such as a furnace

**Previewing a base:**

- To preview where a base will spawn, you can:
  - Shift + Right Click a compressed base
  - Craft the Base Previewer and Shift + Right Click on any block while holding the item
    - If you Shift + Right Click on a Compressed Base, it will render the base and its extensions
